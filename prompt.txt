Review the CPP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file for the high plan of this project. Then review the more low level plan files in the cpp_plan directory. 

I just completed stesp 8-10 of the cpp_plan. Review the solution and provide feedback on the implementation. Discuss any ways that the implementation was implemented that did not align with the plan. 

Currently I'm on step cpp_plan/08_basic_mcts_node_structure.md. 

Lets first discuss our current project setup and then start planning on how to implement this step.
