we need a new move selection function that takes into account the results of simulations. 
we need the stats function to be ordered using the same order as best moves. 



- [] update valuation to favor faster wins and slower losses. 0 for ties, 1 for fast wins, -1 for fast losses. we should scale the wins/losses to be between 0.2 and 1.0, and -0.2 and -1.0 respectively. ties should be 0.0. scale based on number of moves played.
