14. Performance Optimization & Benchmarking
Files: tests/benchmarks/
Implementation:

Create comprehensive benchmarks for each component
Profile critical paths (move generation, rollouts, tree operations)
Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
Document achieved performance metrics

Benchmarks:

Move generation speed
Rollout simulation rate
MCTS iterations per second
Memory usage patterns
Tree reuse effectiveness
